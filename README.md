# aeiou-log

My first React website - a place to write daily notes, keep reminders, etc.

okay so in high school I used to have this google doc on my drive called "aeiou aieou aoeiu", i'm not sure why I called it that but basically it was like a digital journal where I just wrote pretty much everything that happened in my life. I started this document on the first day of grade 11 and I'm now in my second semester of first year university, so you can imagine that it's gotten quite long (even though I didn't write every day). When the original document hit 200+ pages (I use size 8 font across the whole doc) the lag started to become really noticable, not to mention the battery drain my laptop was getting every time I had it open. So I tried making a new document for every year, but deep inside I knew this would only be a temporary solution.

So I've decided to actually create a long term solution to this problem (because the idea of having a complete log of my life is really cool) by making a simple MERN stack application(my first one as I said) which should address the lag and allow me to customize everything even more. Obviously, this is only for my own personal use but since I kinda need to make some personal projects for internships i'm just gonna make this public for the time being.
